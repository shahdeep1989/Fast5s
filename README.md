# Fast5s Housie (Education Housie)
Most important: You need to play in group of 2 or more and join same game in 1 minute of time together. Without that you are not able to play game.
For those who are new to game "Housie", First read all this rules for the game.

Our Housie is a bit different than general Housie, we provided some educational touch. In place of Card we are providing different shape as Tickets. Like,
1) Butterfly (in it Winners will be based on completion of left wing, right wing, middle body, whole butterfly)
2) House (in it Winners will be based on completion of door elements, roof elements, window elements)
3) Human Body (in it Winners will be based on completion of elements on hand, leg, face, chest, etc)
4) Desktop Computer (in it Winners will be based on completion of elements on screen, cpu, mouse and keyboard)

How to play:
> URL: http://169.45.106.232:3000
> Create account (Signup) or Login/Sign-in with created credentials.
> You will get list of games different shapes
> Select any game and click on play, You will enter in a room to play game. Game will start after some waiting time to join more players in a room.
> Multiple players can play game at a time in the same room. We didn't set computer player as of now so you can't play as single user. 
> You will get ticket on your screen. (Like butterfly image with numbers on it. Some number on left wing, some on right wing and some on middle body). And some numbers on all parts. Once game will start you will see the anounced numbers on above the image if that number is present in your ticket click/select that.
> Once game will start you will see some buttons on right side of screen. Like "I have done with left wing", "I have done with right wing", "I have done with middle body" and "I have done with full butterfly". You can claim your price by clicking that button if you finished with any part or full ticket. If you had selected any number which has not been announced than you will be disqualified for that ticket. And if you are correct than you will be the winner.
> Now you can play same game again or play with some new shapes.
> We can enhance this game by showing alphabets in place of number. We can set different images as an elements in place of number. Like fruits, animals, body parts, etc.

Admin Panel:
> URL: http://169.45.106.232:3000/admin
> We created admin panel from which we can create new games with any shape. 
> We can define rules for winners by describing parts of the image as winners. We can set element positions to show on image/tickets for each game.
> We can set interval of time between announcing two numbers.
> We can see list of games, players, winners for each game and each rooms and do all operations on all of it.

API/WebServices:
> Also we had created api/web-services.
> Also prepared proper documentation for developers to test api/web-services.
